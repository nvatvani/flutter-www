# Welcome to My Blog

*17 December 2025*

Welcome to my personal blog! This is where I'll share insights, learnings, and reflections from my journey in technology leadership and the energy sector.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- 🔋 **Energy Transition** — The technical challenges and opportunities in decarbonising our energy systems
- 🚗 **Smart Mobility** — EV charging, V2G technology, and the future of transport
- 💱 **FinTech** — Foreign Exchange, Money Transfers, and the future of payments
- 💡 **Product Leadership** — Lessons learned from building and scaling technology products
- 🌍 **Tech for Good** — How technology (AI/ML, IoT, etc...) can drive positive environmental and economic/social impact

## Why Blog?

After nearly two decades in tech, from coding C applications for payment terminals / embedded systems to leading energy tech startups, I've accumulated experiences worth sharing. This blog is my way of giving back to the community that has helped me grow.

> "We are living through a unique period on this planet where Climate / Environmental, Socio-Economic / Geopolitical, and Technological changes are happening at a rate unmatched in Human History. Crossing the various tipping points are inevitable and the impact will be felt indefinitely. What will we - the instigators of the Anthropocene epoch in this planet's history - create?"

Stay tuned for more posts!
