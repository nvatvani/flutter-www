# Welcome to My Blog

*December 17, 2024*

Welcome to my personal blog! This is where I'll share insights, learnings, and reflections from my journey in technology leadership and the energy sector.

## What to Expect

I plan to write about:

- 🔋 **Energy Transition** — The technical challenges and opportunities in decarbonising our energy systems
- 🚗 **Smart Mobility** — EV charging, V2G technology, and the future of transport
- 💡 **Product Leadership** — Lessons learned from building and scaling technology products
- 🌍 **Tech for Good** — How technology can drive positive environmental and economic/social impact

## Why Blog?

After nearly two decades in tech, from coding C applications for payment terminals / embedded systems to leading energy tech startups, I've accumulated experiences worth sharing. This blog is my way of giving back to the community that has helped me grow.

> "The climate crisis is upon us and I am seeing the effects first-hand living in Northen Europe. I am determined to do my part to address this crisis and contribute to a sustainable future."

Stay tuned for more posts!
