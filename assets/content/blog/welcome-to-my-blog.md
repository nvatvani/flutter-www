## Hello World!

Welcome to my new personal website. After years of focusing on building products and leading teams, I've finally taken the time to create a space where I can share my thoughts and experiences.

### What to Expect

This blog will cover topics close to my heart:

- **Energy Transition** — Insights from my work at Hiven Energy on smart charging, demand response, and the future of distributed energy resources
- **Technology Leadership** — Lessons learned from leading teams across multiple industries and continents
- **Product Development** — Building products that matter in the CleanTech space
- **Personal Reflections** — Thoughts on work-life balance, continuous learning, and growth

### Why Now?

After nearly two decades in the tech industry—from developing prepaid systems at Seamless, to managing risk platforms at Macquarie, to now driving the energy transition at Hiven—I've accumulated experiences worth sharing.

The energy transition is one of the most important challenges of our time, and I believe sharing knowledge accelerates progress.
