# The Major Gripe with International Money Transfer Apps

*11 February 2026*

Wise, Remitly, Revolut, etc... are all significantly better, both in terms of speed and cost, than traditional banks when it comes to transferring money internationally. But they all have one major annoyance!

## The Problem

Wise is the only platform having the capability to set up recurring conversions. But, it is done as follows:
1. Set up a recurring transfer

2. Select the recipient
3. Set up a frequency (daily, weekly, monthly)
![Frequency](2-frequency.png)
4. You only get to setup either the sent, or received amount. You do not get to set the rate at which the conversion is triggered.

5. You are never allowed to set a target conversion rate. You are only *warned* that the future rate will differ from the current rate.

6. Wise mitigates this inconvenience by allowing you to subscribe to rate alerts, opening you up to getting spammed in your mailbox or phone's notification window courtesy of the Wise app.

None of the platforms provide the means for users to **set-and-forget** a recurring fx-transfer or fx-conversion that is executed only when the exchange rate is within a certain band of the target rate.

Whatever the frequency of the transfers, the platforms expect the users to manually set the target-conversion-rate, no matter how (un)realistic, and then apply the (un)realistic rate (similar to the Wise Rate Alert spamming/notifications) when the time comes. If you want to change it, you have to cancel the schedule and re-create it all over again!

Here are the actual instructions / limitations from the various platforms:

1. **Wise**: https://wise.com/help/articles/2978063/what-are-scheduled-transfers

2. **Remitly**: *Not Supported*

3. **Revolut**: *Not Supported*

## The Solution: AI/ML-Driven Forecasting

While providers claim they "can't predict the future," modern **Time Series Forecasting** models can achieve 60-80% accuracy for short horizons.

By applying these models to currency pairs, we can verify if a target rate is realistic within a 20-day window, enabling true **"set-and-forget"** transfers that only execute when the market moves in your favor.

## Live Proof of Concept

I built a live demonstration using **Marimo** and **Python** to forecast some currency-pairs relevant to my needs. It combines Nowcasting (current trend) with Forecasting (future probability).
