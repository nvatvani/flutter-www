## The Challenge

The global energy system is undergoing its most significant transformation since the industrial revolution. As we integrate more renewable energy sources like solar and wind, we face a fundamental challenge: supply is becoming variable while demand continues to grow.

### Enter Demand Response

Traditional power grids were designed for predictable, one-way power flow. But with millions of electric vehicles, heat pumps, and home batteries coming online, we have an unprecedented opportunity to reshape demand to match supply.

> "The future grid is not just about generating clean energy—it's about consuming energy intelligently."

## What We're Building at Hiven

At Hiven Energy, we're developing solutions that:

1. **Optimize Charging Schedules** — Using day-ahead spot prices, time-of-use tariffs, and carbon intensity data to charge EVs when energy is cleanest and cheapest

2. **Enable Grid Services** — Allowing distributed energy resources to participate in frequency regulation and capacity markets

3. **Integrate Home Energy Systems** — Connecting solar PV, batteries, and heat pumps for holistic home energy management

### The Technology Stack

Our platform integrates with:

- **EVs** via OEM APIs for direct vehicle communication
- **Chargers** via OCPP and OCPI protocols
- **TSOs** for real-time grid signals and market participation

## Looking Ahead

The energy transition isn't just about replacing fossil fuels—it's about reimagining how we generate, distribute, and consume energy. Smart technology is the key enabler.
